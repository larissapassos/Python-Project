Project Description
===================

Breakout is an arcade game developed by Atari in 1972. The purpose of the game is to clear the brick lines, using a ball that travels across the screen. 
When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses when the ball drops to the bottom of the screen. 
In this project, we implemented a Python version of Breakout, with a modularized approach, allowing for easy addition of levels or new game modes.

Currently, Breakython consists of 5 levels. The brick lines become more resilient & dense as each level is completed. The speed of the ball and the speed of
the paddle are scale with each passing level. Our choice of level representation and scaling allows any user to easily create new levels for the game.

===========
How to Play
===========

Arrow keys (UP/DOWN) - move through menu choices
Arrow keys (R/L) - move the paddle
ENTER - choose option in menu
ESC - pause game
SPACE - launches ball

=======================================
Library modules and 3rd party libraries
=======================================

- pyGame: library used to easily develop games in python
- pickle: used to read map files
- sys: standard system operations
- time: used by mainly pygame in rendering operations

=============================
Structure of the Project/Code
=============================

-> Resources
------------

Several resources used in the project (such as images and fonts) have been stored in the "resources" directory.
The images are loaded by pygame's functions while the levels are loaded by pickle.

-> Level Representation
-----------------------

Levels are represented as a 5x16 matrix in text files. Each position contains a number from 0 to 3, 0 being
a free position in the brick line and x=(1, 2, 3) being a brick with resistance x.

Bricks with resistance 1 are colored orange (normal).
Bricks with resistance 2 are colored brown (resemble wood).
Bricks with resistance 3 are colored gray (resemble metal). 

-> Code Structure
-----------------
  
The project itself is divided in three main modules: game_elements, game and breakython.

The game_elements module contains the classes used to represent the main game elements. 
The game module contains functions which, when called, will modify the state of the current game_elements as it was specified by the user’s input in the GUI. 
The breakython module (the main module) contains the graphical interface and, through user input, will use the corresponding game functions.

In-depth documentation of the aforementioned modules is included is html files generated by pydoc as well as comments on the code.

==================
Running Breakython
==================

Breakython can be runned using python3.4.
The user can open the breakython.py file manually (by double-clicking it) or type

$ python breakython.py

in the command line in order to run it.

Additional Information
======================

The project was developed using github.
